# Useful libraries
1. **ZINC database** (https://zinc.docking.org/). This library includes more than 200,000,000 chemical ligands from different sources. 
Most of these ligands are generated from chemical studies, and some are rooted in theoretical studies. So, using this library might require some preparation steps to screen its content for virtual docking purposes. This library is free of charge for educational uses. 
2. **APExBIO** (https://www.apexbt.com/). This database includes thousands of approved ligands for virtual screening purposes. Based on the goal of your project, you can select a chemical library for docking analysis. Please note that this database is not free of charge because its content is commercially prepared for screening processes. Surprisingly, the APExBIO content can be found in ZINC chemical ligands differently. In each section of this database, you can download the sdf library of given compounds, but essential information about these ligands should be purchased from the developer of this database. However, it has some free options for academic users, and you can use this content for further docking projects. 
3. **Bioactive compound library** (https://www.medchemexpress.com/virtual-screening.html). This database also includes many chemical ligands for docking projects, but it is not free of charge.  
4. **Phenol-explorer 3.0** (http://phenol-explorer.eu/). This database was specifically developed for plant polyphenols so that it includes more than 3,000 phenolic compounds that can be downloaded for docking analysis. This database also includes essential food sources and some pharmacokinetics features of the given compounds. It is free of charge. 
5. **BIAdb** (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/biadb/help.html). This is a specific database for alkaloids. It is free of charge, and by submitting your request to get the whole set of its chemical ligands, you can copy its content.  
6. **MetIDB** (http://metidb.org). This is also a free database of chemical ligands. I think its website is presently unavailable, but I have a copy of its compounds in sdf format that you can use. This database mainly contains critical information about polyphenols and related plant metabolites. 
7. **DrugBank** (https://go.drugbank.com/releases/latest). This is a free-of-charge chemical library for medicinal purposes. Its database size is 154 Mb and comprises thousands of approved drugs by FDA. I used this database to screen possible inhibitors of human kinases, and it works fine. 
8. **PubChem** (https://pubchemdocs.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/downloads). This is also a free-of-charge chemical library, including more general compounds in any field. The major challenge with PubChem is that you had to optimize the downloaded compounds using secondary tools such as OpenBable and hyperchem. It requires some time to purify the PubChem database from unwanted compounds and ligands. It is a big library for virtual docking projects. To use PubChem as docking input, you need to have perfect hardware facilities to finish your docking procedure. 
9. **ChemSpider** (http://www.chemspider.com/). To get the chemical library of Chemspider, you need to submit an academic request through its website. I have not used this database for virtual dockings yet, but it seems clear that it comprises more than 114,000,000 small ligands for docking projects. Unfortunately, for Iranian researchers accessing such databases are impossible because of the sanction policies that the owners of these databases followed. Using this database is free of charge. This tool (http://durrantlab.com/gypsum-dl/) can support you in generating high-quality databases of chemical ligands. 
9. **MTiOpenScreen** (https://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/services/MTiOpenScreen/#overview-access). This is a free-of-charge virtual screening tool comprised of several databases of chemical ligands as a default option. It has some limitations for chemical libraries submitted by users, but it works fine for some docking projects. I mainly use more than five tools to confirm my docking results when performing docking analysis. So, based on my previous experiences with this tool, I think it can be useful for some default virtual docking projects against specific chemical ligands. This paper also provides essential information regarding available chemical libraries for docking purposes (https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/22/2/1790/5809605).
