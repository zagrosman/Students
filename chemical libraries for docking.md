# Useful libraries
1. **ZINC database** (https://zinc.docking.org/). This library includes more than 200,000,000 chemical ligands from different sources. 
Most of these ligands are generated from chemical studies, and some are rooted in theoretical studies. So, using this library might require some preparation steps to screen its content for virtual docking purposes. This library is free of charge for educational uses.
